# Workflow Improvements - Project Management & Data Protection

## Overview
The HVAC Scanner App now includes structured project management with mandatory customer validation and intelligent data protection to prevent equipment data loss.

## New Workflow Features

### 🚪 **Customer Validation Gate**
**Before**: Users could start scanning equipment without entering customer information
**After**: Mandatory customer name and location entry before any equipment scanning

#### Customer Validation Screen:
- **Full-screen modal** blocks access until customer info is entered
- **Required fields**: Customer Name and Location
- **Professional design** with clear instructions
- **Success confirmation** when project starts

#### Benefits:
- **Organized data**: All equipment tied to specific customer projects
- **Better exports**: Customer info included in all exports
- **Professional workflow**: Structured project-based approach

### 🛡️ **Unsaved Equipment Protection**
**Before**: Users could lose equipment data when navigating away or uploading new images
**After**: Smart detection and protection of unsaved equipment data

#### Protection Triggers:
- **Uploading new images** while equipment form has data
- **Navigating between images** with unsaved equipment
- **Any navigation** away from current equipment data

#### Unsaved Equipment Dialog:
- **Equipment preview** showing current form data
- **Three clear options**:
  - ✅ **Save to Equipment List** - Adds equipment to project
  - 🗑️ **Discard Changes** - Permanently removes unsaved data
  - ❌ **Cancel** - Returns to current form
- **Equipment details display** showing what would be lost

## Technical Implementation

### 📊 **State Management Updates**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  // ... existing fields
  isCustomerValidated: boolean;    // Track customer validation
  unsavedEquipment: EquipmentData | null;  // Track unsaved data
  showUnsavedDialog: boolean;      // Control dialog visibility
}
```

### 🔄 **Workflow Flow**
1. **App Launch** → Customer Validation Screen
2. **Enter Customer Info** → Main Scanner Interface
3. **Upload Images** → Equipment Form with Data Protection
4. **Form Changes** → Automatic Unsaved Equipment Tracking
5. **Navigation Attempts** → Unsaved Equipment Dialog
6. **Save Equipment** → Clear unsaved data, add to list

### 🎯 **Smart Detection Logic**
```typescript
// Unsaved equipment detection
const hasData = formData.manufacturer || formData.model || formData.assetType || 
               formData.serialNumber || formData.size || formData.notes;

if (hasData) {
  setState(prev => ({ ...prev, unsavedEquipment: formData }));
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 🎨 **Visual Design**
- **Customer Validation**: Clean, professional full-screen interface
- **Unsaved Dialog**: Modal overlay with equipment preview
- **Clear Actions**: Distinct buttons for save/discard/cancel
- **Status Indicators**: Toast notifications for all actions

### 🔔 **User Feedback**
- **Success Messages**: "Project started for [Customer] at [Location]"
- **Warning Messages**: "Please enter customer information before uploading"
- **Action Confirmations**: "Equipment saved to list" / "Unsaved equipment discarded"

### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile-friendly** customer validation screen
- **Touch-optimized** dialog buttons
- **Accessible** keyboard navigation

## Workflow Scenarios

### 📋 **Scenario 1: New Project**
1. User opens app → Customer Validation screen appears
2. User enters "ABC Company" and "123 Main St"
3. Clicks "Start Equipment Scanning" → Main interface loads
4. User can now upload images and scan equipment

### 📸 **Scenario 2: Equipment Data Protection**
1. User uploads image → Equipment form populates with data
2. User starts editing equipment details
3. User tries to upload new image → Unsaved Equipment Dialog appears
4. User chooses "Save to Equipment List" → Equipment saved, new upload proceeds

### 🔄 **Scenario 3: Navigation Protection**
1. User has unsaved equipment data in form
2. User clicks "Next Image" → Unsaved Equipment Dialog appears
3. User chooses "Discard Changes" → Equipment data cleared, navigation proceeds
4. User can continue with new image

## Benefits

### ✅ **Data Protection**
- **Zero data loss**: Equipment data never lost accidentally
